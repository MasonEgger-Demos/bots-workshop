# Build Your First Discord Bot

This tutorial has you build *Randombot*, a fun little bot with the following commands:

When the bot "hears" the following phrases in any discord channel, it will do
the following

* "roll a die" or "roll a dice" - Roll a 6 sided die and give you the result
* "roll a d<X>" - Roll a die with the specified amount of sides and give you the result
* "flip a coin" - Flip a coin and give you the result
* "pick a card" - Choose a random card from a standard 52 card deck and give you the result
